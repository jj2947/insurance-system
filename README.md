<h1> Insurance System </h1>

Developed a system that an insurance company can use to manage their clients and policies. 

<h2> System Functionality </h2>

- Add new clients<br>
- Delete existing clients<br>
- Add new policies for existing clients<br>
- Calculate the cost of premiums for any given policy<br>
- Calculate the total cost of premiums for all policies for a client<br>
- Applying discounts for clients who have multiple policies<br>

<h2> Using the system </h2>

The insurance system uses a command line interface. The system is controlled by a menu that will be displayed on the terminal and allows the staff member to select from a list of commands. The staff member will be able to select a command by typing its code, and any arguments it expects. Some commands require additional options, which are prompted by the system one at a time. The system will then execute the appropriate action.
